    <br/>
    <p>Here are a few tips to keep in mind while planning a park wedding: Other types of construction activities, not listed here, may require a permit. Ensure main entrances and exits are not blocked.</p>
        <h3>If It Is On Your Own Property, I Would Imagine You Don&#039;t Need A Permit, But You Should Check With City Hall Just To Be Sure.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Apply to the permit office as soon as possible to ensure approval and availability. But if you prefer to spend the wee morning hours in the arms of your new husband or wife, consider a staged exit. You want to make sure you are able to accommodate the number of guests you are inviting comfortably, and also have a flow of tables, chairs, eating and beverage stations, generators, even a dance floor and more.</p>
        <h3>If You And Your Significant Other Are Considering A Backyard Wedding, Take A Look At Our Backyard Wedding Checklist.</h3>

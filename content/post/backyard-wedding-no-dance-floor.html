Use mason jars as vases, put tea lights in them for safe candle holders, fill them with treats, and more.</p>

        <p>Bright colors or hypnotizing patterns on the dance floor will surely energize the mood for your reception, as your guests are drawn to the dance floor. Trouble is, the dance floor would go directly in the middle of that flat section, which means it would get in the way of the ceremony foot traffic and chairs (my aisle goes from the cement pad closest to the house to the steps, so right over where the dance floor would go).</p>

        <p>One of the biggest perks to any backyard wedding is that you can light up the night with as many or as little light as you feel needed. Generally speaking, youâ€™ll want three square feet for every couple.</p>

        <p>You will need a piece of timber to go around each side of each plywood â€˜blockâ€™. If your backyard wedding has a rustic, outdoor theme, mason jars are perfect for various uses.</p>

        <h3>â€œMake Sure You Look At The Sunset Time For Your Wedding Date When Deciding The Guest Arrival And Ceremony Start Times.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Allow guests and little ones the fun of playing wedding games like cornhole or giant connect four. You can make these from lengths of 2Ã—2 inch timber. I am doing a completely diy wedding, and very low cost.</p>
        <h3>So What Is The Perfect Size?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I said yes of couese. If your yard doesn&#039;t have a patio or other paved space for dancing, adding a dance floor is one of the backyard wedding ideas we&#039;d definitely recommend. Hereâ€™s a handy guide for selecting outdoor dance floor sizes to rent:</p>
        <h3>Getting The Perfect Size Makes For The Perfect Dance Party.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Generally speaking, youâ€™ll want three square feet for every couple. While a checkered dance floor is classic, we love the idea of switching it up just a bit. Trouble is, the dance floor would go directly in the middle of that flat section, which means it would get in the way of the ceremony foot traffic and chairs (my aisle goes from the cement pad closest to the house to the steps, so right over where the dance floor would go).</p>
        <h3>Inquire With Your Venue And See If They Can Do It For You.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Orignally our plans didn&#039;t include to have it and got the call to ace it down. This is a pretty easy project to do considering how cool this dance floor turns out. One of the biggest perks to any backyard wedding is that you can light up the night with as many or as little light as you feel needed.</p>
        <h3>The Reception In In The Backyard, Which Is Nice And Flat.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Not all couples want a highly formal wedding reception with a sit down dinner; Get creative with mason jars. Then add two more pieces to each block to reinforce them.</p>

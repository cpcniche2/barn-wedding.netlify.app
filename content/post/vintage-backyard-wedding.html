        <p>Nothing is more romantic than a barn wedding and when it takes place in your own backyard well that is even better. It did have a lot of 1940’s themed things but it was subtle and i don’t think people knew the era. We are not sure if you remember when we featured this adorable record sleeve save the dates but, we are extremely jazzed to see them used at an actual wedding.</p>

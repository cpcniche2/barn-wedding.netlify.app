        <h3>Tents Can Costs Upwards Of $15,000 If You Want Something That Is Rainproof, Windproof, Weatherproof, Temperature Controlled With Lights And A Dance Floor.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This is key to a cheap wedding, for two big reasons: Not sure what your budget is! You might not have a backup rain plan or an indoor space to host your desired guest count.</p>
        <h3>Backyard Weddings Can Be Cheaper But They Can Easily Also Cost $10,000.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Sounds responsible… and like a great excuse. You are going to have to build your vision and team from the ground up. Since 2020 that figure has been trending downward and now the average wedding costs $25,000.*.</p>
        <h3>How The Cost Of Backyard Weddings Compare To Venue Weddings.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>You are saving a good amount by not paying for the venue which is around $8000 on average. A backyard wedding can definitely save you a lot of money, but you can also go all out and spend a fortune. The baker at jenny’s brother’s coffee shop whipped them up to the tune of $100.</p>
        <h3>This Is Attributed To Most Couples Choosing To Keep Guest Counts Down, With The Venue And Catering Still.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If you are hosting a backyard wedding, and you are hosting it by yourself without the help of an event planner, we recommend 13 months to 2 years. The prices can range depending on what additional services and supplies are included, but the wedding venue can sometimes account for almost half the wedding budget. There really is no place like home.</p>
        <h3>There Are Many Reasons A Couple May Choose A Diy Wedding, Including The Potential Savings.</h3>

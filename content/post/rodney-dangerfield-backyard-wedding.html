        <p>There was no sign of any hollywood types, and the newlyweds acted like you would expect any newlyweds to act. There was some nudity in this scene (some girl&#039;s shirt rolls up exposing her large, um, assets) so i don&#039;t think this was made for a tv version, though i did see this uncut on a local tv station over 15 years ago, back when they&#039;d show uncut movies in prime time (still have the tape!)</p>
